<h2>Operation Market Garden</h2>Version 0.8.4
			<br>A mod of Dagon81's Arnhem map by SuperNova
			  <br>
			  <br><b>--Historical Info--</b>
				<br>
				<br>The infamous attempt by the Allies to capture a stretch of roadway that crossed the Rhine River, thus giving the Allies a speedy way into Nazi Germany.
				  <br>
				<br>The operation's ultimate goal was to end the war in Europe by Christmas of 1944.
				<br>
				<br>However, it didn't quite work that way. The Allies under-estimated the German defenders. 
				<br>
				<br>The XXX Corps was bogged down by unexpected resistance along what was known as Highway 69 (nicknamed Hell's Highway).
				<br>
				<br>British Paratroopers ignored reports of the 2nd SS Panzer division being stationed around Arnhem. 
				<br>
				<br>The 82nd Airborne encountered severe German resistance in Nijmegen.
				<br>
				<br>The 101st Airborne were attacked by German Troops retreating from the XXX Corps advance. 
				<br>
				<br>The Germans recovered a map containing the entire Market Garden plan from a dead American 82nd Airborne Officer.
				<br>
				  <br><h2>This is a 9 round game</h2>
				                         a round for each day
				<br><h3>Designed for solo play against the AI</h3>
				                         AI is the Germans by default
							   <br>
				  <br> <h2>- Victory Conditions - </h2>
				<br>
				<br>Germans win if they destroy any of the Trucks,
				<br>OR prevent them from reaching Apeldoorn by Round 9,
				<br>OR Control any part of the Victory Road by the end of Round 9.
				<br>
				<br>The Allies must reach Apldoorn with the 4 Trucks
				<br>AND control the entire Victory Road by the end of Round 9.
				<br>
				  <br><h2> - Special Rules - </h2>
				<br><b>Combat lasts Only One Round</b>
				<br>
				<br><b>No more than 8 land units from each country allowed per territory!</b>
				<br>There <b>can</b> be 8 UK and US land units in one territory.  
				<br>Note that the if a territory has more than 8 land units at the start of the game they can remain until you move them.
		 		<br>
				<br><b>Do not move the reinforcments until round 2</b>
				<br>1st, 82nd, and 101st reinforcements arrive during combat movement on Round 2.  
				<br>They can land only on the designated landing areas (82nd can only land in any territory with the 82nd Airborne insignia a Parachute insignia, etc.). 
				<br><b>Currenty this is not supported in the game's code</b> but the rule is they cannot move further than the drop zones until 1 round after they land. .
				<br>
				  <br> <h2>- Unit Statistics -</h2>
				<br>attack/defense/movement - unit
				<br>
				<br>1/2/2 - Infantry (can recieve support)
				<br>2/2/2 - Paratroopers/German Elites
				<br>2/3/2 - British Special Forces
				<br>2/2/2 - Artillery (supports Infantry)
				<br>2/2/4 - Jeeps/Mechanized Units (can blitz)
				<br>3/3/4 - Tank (can blitz)
				<br>0/0/4 - Truck
				<br>4/0/20 - Airstrike (disposable unit)
				<br>
				<br>There are 4 Trucks in the game, all British.  The Trucks are required to win the game, so keep them safe.  
				<br>They cannot blitz.  They can be attacked by German Airstrikes, so don't leave them alone if the Germans still have Airstrikes left.  
			        <br>If they stay at the XXX HQ with a continued defence, the Germans will not attack them.  But they will have to move eventually.
				<br>
				<br>The Airstrike is essentially a Suicidal Munitions unit.  It makes one preemtive attack, and then it is removed from play. 
				<br>It can attack with land units (in fact, it is recomended that you do this).
				<br>
				<br> <h2>- Tips -</h2>
				<br>British - Protect your Trucks.  You need them to win!  Try to keep your Trucks together and behind the front.  It is best to move the Trucks during your non-combat move.  As for the 1st, capture the 2 bridges.  You can split the Germans in half by capturing Arnhem on your first turn, thus having 2 smaller groups to deal with instead of 1 big group.  Beware German reinforcements coming from the left.  As for the XXX, keep a close eye on the German units on your right flank.
				<br>
				<br>Americans - Try and clear a path for the XXX Tanks and Trucks to blitz past.  You can use your Jeeps to 'scout', by blitzing through multiple territories, allowing the Infantry to advance more quickly.  Watch both Flanks of the road.  Don't Die!
				<br>
				<br>If playing as the Germans - Conserve your units!  You don't get any reinforcements, so attack wisely.  Try to take the bridges and stall the XXX Corps as long as possible.  Remember that you can move 1 unit into the line of the XXX Tanks and it will prevent them from blitzing.  You have a large number of troops on the bottom right of the board, and your first instinct will be to move them into combat.  However, you can make things tough for the Allies by waiting a round or two before moving them.  Instead of the British blitzing all the way to Arnhem, they will be forced to leave some units behind in case you attack the Road
